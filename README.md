# MorseCode
There are two programs. morse.py translates an input, the user gives, to morse code and uses a buzzer to express the morse code. the other program, buttonMorse.py, utilizes a button that, when clicked, will send a signal to the buzzer to sound off. Making it so that the user can make their own morse code phrases. 

To use these programs, make sure to run "pip install pyMorseTranslator" as well as "pip install RPi.GPIO" in your terminal.
